# üëè Welcome to my MSAI coursework repository. 

Here you will find a brief description of the courses as well as all of the programming assignments for each of the courses.

Courses completed so far.
## 1. Ethics in AI
The goal of this course is to prepare AI professionals for the important ethical responsibilities that come with developing systems that may have important, perhaps even life-and-death, consequences.

Students first learn about both the history of ethics and the history of AI, to understand the basis for contemporary, global ethical perspectives (including non-Western and feminist perspectives) and the factors that have influenced the design, development, and deployment of AI-based systems. Students then explore the societal dimensions of the ethics and values of AI. Finally,
students explore the technical dimensions of the ethics and values of AI, including design considerations such as fairness, accountability, transparency, power, and agency.

Students should take this course to prepare them for the ethical challenges that they will face throughout their careers, and to carry out the important responsibilities that come with being an AI professional. The ethical dimensions of AI may have important implications for AI professionals and their employers. For example, the release of unsafe or biased AI-based systems
may cause liability issues and reputational damage. This course will help students to identify design decisions with ethical implications, and to consider the perspectives of users and other stakeholders when making these ethically significant design decisions.
